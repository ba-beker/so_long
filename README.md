# So Long
A simple project completed as part of the 42 school curriculum called "so_long." This project showcases my front-end development skills and involves creating a basic game using C programming language.


## How It's Made:

This project was built using C programming language, and it demonstrates my proficiency in writing code and creating a basic game. The game involves navigating a player character through a maze, collecting objects and avoiding obstacles. It utilizes various programming concepts such as file handling, data structures, and algorithms.

Throughout the project, I leveraged my knowledge of C to implement the game logic, handle user input, render graphics, and manage game states. The code is organized into modules to ensure maintainability and readability. I also incorporated error handling to provide informative feedback to the user in case of any issues.

## Optimizations

While working on this project, I focused on creating a functional and efficient game. I took the following optimization measures:

Implemented an optimized algorithm to efficiently render the game graphics and update the screen.
Employed data structures, such as arrays and linked lists, to store and manage game elements, resulting in improved performance.
Utilized memory management techniques to minimize memory leaks and ensure efficient resource utilization.
Employed file buffering techniques to optimize file I/O operations, enhancing the game's responsiveness.
These optimizations allowed the game to run smoothly and ensured a pleasant user experience.

## Lessons Learned:

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges and had numerous moments of triumph. Here are some of the key lessons I learned:

Problem-solving skills: Building a game from scratch required breaking down complex tasks into manageable components and devising effective solutions. This project enhanced my ability to analyze problems and think critically to find optimal solutions.

Game development concepts: Creating a game involved understanding key game development concepts, such as rendering, collision detection, and game loops. This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge and gain practical experience in these areas.

Code organization and modularity: Developing a complex project like this reinforced the importance of well-organized and modular code. I learned to structure my codebase in a way that promotes reusability, readability, and maintainability.

Attention to detail: While working on the project, I realized the significance of paying attention to even the smallest details. Whether it was handling edge cases, optimizing performance, or improving user interactions, a keen eye for detail was crucial to delivering a polished final product.
